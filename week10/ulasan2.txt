In this blog I’m Keyne Kassapa Oei and my friend M.Farrel Yaman A.P will discuss a video 
about input and output system (I/O system) and device driver which was uploaded by Umass OS 
with the title of the video is Lecture 18: I/O system and device drivers with the duration 
of 1 hours 19 seconds in link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0GVUkUGGao.

In I/O system there are components that we need to know which are of system bus, port, controller and the devices itself. 
which the port are consist of status that indicates a device, control , data-in, and data-out. 
The lowest piece of software are device drivers, device drivers are basically piece of code inside kernel that talk to device controllers, 
the job of device driver is to handle different types of commands. In I/O system there is called Direct Memory Access(DMA), 
the job of DMA is to make that we don’t transfer large data at a time, the idea of DMA is that the DMA controller is going 
to function as a stand-in for CPU while the device is doing I/O. 

I/O device have buffer memory where they store data before being transferred to CPU, buffer is to cope with speed mismatch, 
so it can store in the buffer of data first then transferred it to CPU. We can improve performance by caching, 
the idea is we can improve performance by accessing the disk a fewer number of times. if we do read and write the first 
thing to do is to see wether we have that data in the past, if we have the data in the past we can just handle it 
immediately without doing any disc I/O.

To summarize I/O is very expensive and we need to make very slow I/O device work efficiently with a much faster main memory in CPU.
This is a very good video because this video teach us to make I/O device to work efficiently and faster main memory in the CPU, 
this video also showing some problem which was shown in the class so we can study it with this video.
