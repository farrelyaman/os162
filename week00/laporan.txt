last week we are studying about intelectual property. intelectual property are something that we own it doesnt have physical. the example of intelectual property are:
-trademark : that is if we have something that we own then we mark it so nobody can take it (e.g CocaCola,Nike)
-servicemark : that is something that was made so that the trademark will be unique
-trade secret : it is the secret recipe of a restaurant

in intelectual property there are copyright so we cannot take those property without permission from the owner

also there is free software and open source they are almost the same but open source are more rilexing.

thats the summary of the lesson last week.
